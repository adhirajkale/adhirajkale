<h1>Cars</h1>
<br>
<p>A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people, have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them.</p>
